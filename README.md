## Introduction
```
Flappy bird with Posenet posture recognization
In this project users could use their body(uplifting/downlifring arms) 
to take control of flappy bird drawn on canvas to let it fly up/downn.
```
## description
the project use ml5 library's neural traning network to distingush user's arm position:
it has three according position:
'H' stands for horizontal
'D' stands for down
'U' stands for up

Using the postion of the body, the user can control the bird flying up&down
## Built With
* [css] - for laying out and structuring web pages

* [Javascript] - used to make web pages interactive

* [html] - standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser

* [p5] - is a JavaScript library for creative coding for camera layout

* [ml5.js] - ml5.js is machine learning for the web in your web browser. Through some clever and exciting advancements, the folks building TensorFlow.js figured out that it is possible to use the web browser's built in graphics processing unit (GPU) to do calculations that would otherwise run very slowly using central processing unit (CPU)
